## API

#### [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/api/)

Nookipedia is a private API that holds all kinds of information about animal crossing.

It's made by a small community of animal crossing enthiousiast. Because of the hype for the game, they're not accepting new applications for a key at the moment. (so I got really lucky!!)

example of how the API is used:
`https://nookipedia.com/api/endpoint/parameter/?api_key=KEY`

API endpoints that I used:

- `today` (shows a daily message)
- `villager` ( + a villager name which is required as a parameter)

example data if you request `today`

```
{{"message":
"Today is Tuesday, May 5th. We have the following announcements for today:",
"events":["Today is Paolo and Daisy Mae's birthday!"],
"villager_images":["https:\/\/dodo.ac\/np\/images\/thumb\/5\/59\/Paolo_NH.png\/175px-Paolo_NH.png","https:\/\/dodo.ac\/np\/images\/thumb\/6\/69\/Daisy_Mae_NH.png\/175px-Daisy_Mae_NH.png"]}"}
```

example data if you request a `villager`

```
{"message":
"Here's some information on Apollo:","name":"Apollo","image":"https:\/\/dodo.ac\/np\/images\/thumb\/2\/28\/Apollo_NH.png\/175px-Apollo_NH.png",

#### rate limit

there's no mention about a ratelimit, but that doesn't mean you should go crazy with your API calls ðŸ˜…
